# Tokens, Tokens & Tokens

Tokens are digital assets created, owned and circulated on a Blockchain Network. A token is governed by a piece of code (a smart contract) that is deployed over the network. This code keeps track of the supply, ownership and balances of that particular token.

What’s the difference between a cryptocurrency and a token, I hear you cry:

- Cryptocurrency is native to a Blockchain network. A Blockchain can have only one cryptocurrency but a million tokens. For example, Ethereum has its native currency, ether, but regulates multiple tokens such as USDC, AVAX, UNI, USDT, etc.
- Tokens are backed by a smart contract and can contain various functionalities depending upon different use cases. For example, security tokens, utility tokens, etc.
- Tokens can represent any asset on a blockchain network. For example, art, equity, insurance, identity, tickets, etc.

## ERC Standards

ERC standards describe the rules and functioning of the ERC tokens. **ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment** and its standards are reviewed by the Ethereum community and modified according to current requirements.

ERC standards are solely applicable to smart contracts that regulate the functionality behind a particular token type. They provide all the functions for a token’s basic behaviour. Smart contracts implementing these standards must properly implement these functions in order to make them seamlessly operable and interactive.

Broadly, there are three basic token standards and more will be added over time. Let’s understand them one by one.

### ERC20

This standard is used to implement the functionality behind Fungible tokens. Fungible Tokens of a type are all alike and can be exchanged for the same value. For example, USDC, UNI, AVAX, DAI, etc. You can view its implementation in Additional Resources should you wish1.

### ERC721

This standard is for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Tokens of this type are meant to be unique and cannot be exchanged for the same value given that none of them are alike. For example, Bored Apes, CryptoKitties, etc. You can view its implementation in Additional Resources should you wish2. You’ll have the chance to dive into a full module on NFTs later in the programme – you’ll even release your own collection! 

### ERC1155

This standard is used to implement functionalities of both fungible and non-fungible tokens. It can also be called a standard for semi-fungible tokens. For example, multiple editions of a song or photographs. You can view its implementation in Additional Resources should you wish3.

In the upcoming lessons, we’ll take you through each of the above standards in more detail and in later modules you’ll implement each of these standards.

## Types of Tokens

There are different types of tokens in Blockchain technology. We will learn about some of them briefly.

### Utility Tokens
These tokens serve a purpose and therefore are used to render a particular service. Different platforms create utility tokens for their services and sell them to the public. People can then utilise these tokens to make use of the service.

Utility tokens are usually platform specific. Organisations create and sell tokens for their platform often through an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). At the time of ICO, tokens are often cheap as compared to the market price (when launched. After the organisation is ready (to launch) the tokens can be exchanged for the service.

### Security Tokens
Also known as equity tokens, these are quite similar to traditional securities. They represent a stock or a share of a company that is sold out after the ICO ends. They possess some rights of the company and trading rules. They are condemned by federal laws. 

The main difference between security tokens and utility tokens is that security tokens are limited and their price varies with the profit or loss of the company. Security tokens can also be accessed outside the platform on which they are developed.

### Reward Tokens:
Reward tokens are special types of tokens that hold the performance or reputation of an individual. Unlike standard tokens, they may not have ‘real’ value. These tokens are usually given as rewards to the users or service providers by the platform based on their performance and/or activity.

Reward tokens are a form of appreciation by the platform and can be used to redeem incentives provided by the platform. These are collected by the platform only and are generally non-tradable. For example, a clothing company gives a token each time an order is placed above £20 and on collecting 100 tokens you can redeem some discounts on other items.

### Asset Tokens
Asset tokens possess the value of a real life asset for example, gold, real estate or bonds, properties, vehicles, etc. These are transferable on the network and hold a global identity, i.e., it doesn’t belong to a specific platform. They ease the method of transferring such assets and remove the hectic traditional process.

NFTs are a great and trending example of asset tokens. These are non-fungible tokens, i.e., an NFT cannot be traded for another NFT. They hold a unique global value. Any piece of artistry, GIFs, tweets, or anything that cannot have a copy of itself and possess a unique property can form an NFT.

### Currency Tokens
Currency Tokens are just like the regular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, except that they can be utilised along with Dapps. They hold a value of their own and can also be traded for other cryptocurrencies. They exist independently on the network and are generally not associated with a platform but a network. 

For example, there are a lot of tokens that have been over the Ethereum network like USDC, USDT. These are termed Stablecoins and both USDC and USDT are backed 1:1 by real, genuine dollars held by the organisations behind the respective tokens. They are tradable just like standard cryptocurrencies.
