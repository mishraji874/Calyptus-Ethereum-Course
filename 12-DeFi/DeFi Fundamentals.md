# DeFi Fundamentals

## What is Decentralised Finance (DeFi)?

Centralised institutions like banks have been in charge of finance for centuries, and this has led to a number of problems, such as high fees, slow transaction times, and a lack of transparency. DeFi is an attempt to solve these issues by moving financial services to the blockchain.

**Decentralised finance (DeFi)** is a movement that aims to create a new financial system that is open to everyone and doesn’t require trusting intermediaries. DeFi relies heavily on cryptography, blockchain and smart contracts to achieve this goal.

**Smart contracts** are the main building blocks of DeFi. 

The goal of DeFi is to create a more equitable and efficient financial system.

DeFi is made up of a variety of decentralised applications (dapps), which allow users to do things like borrow money, invest in projects and trade cryptocurrencies. These dapps are built on top of decentralised protocols, like Ethereum, which allow for secure and trustless interactions between users.

It’s important to note that a large majority of the DeFi projects are currently built on Ethereum. The prime motivation for this is Ethereum’s programming language, Solidity, which enables writing complex smart contracts that can include all the essential logic for DeFi applications. 

Besides that, Ethereum has the most expansive ecosystem out of all smart contract platforms with thousands of developers creating new applications every day and holding the most value in smart contracts – contributing to a snowball effect.

In fact, all the DeFi protocols mentioned in this course are built on Ethereum, and all other modules of this course are based on Ethereum and Solidity.

Now, let’s see how it all started.

## A Quick History of DeFi

The **MakerDAO** project was one of the first to start the decentralised finance movement. MakerDAO is a platform that allows users to generate stablecoins called DAI by locking in collateral such as ETH. DAI can be used to pay for goods and services, or saved on Maker’s Oasis platform.

For reference, a stablecoin is a tokenized version of a real-world currency (like the US dollar).  

Since its launch, MakerDAO has grown to become one of the largest DeFi platforms.

At the time of writing it has over $7 billion of Total Value Locked (TVL) and more than 2 billion DAI have been minted (created and put in circulation).

DeFi is still in its early stages, but there is already a lot of activity in the space. Thousands of developers are working on new DeFi applications, and the TVL of all DeFi protocols combined has reached approximately $62 billion.

With DeFi we are trying to create a whole new financial ecosystem in a permissionless and open way. Lending and borrowing is only one part of this ecosystem.

Some of the other important parts are:

1. Stable coins – Algorithmic and Non-algorithmic
2. Decentralised exchanges
3. Derivatives
4. Margin trading
5. Insurance

## Lending and Borrowing 

In addition to MakerDAO, there are a number of other vital DeFi projects worth mentioning.

Lending and borrowing are two important financial concepts. With lending, you provide someone with money, and they agree to pay you back with interest. With borrowing, you take out a loan from a lender, and agree to pay them back with interest.

There are a few key DeFi projects in this category. First of all, **Compound**. Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol that allows users to supply crypto assets like Ether, BAT, 0x or Tether and start making interest. Supplied assets can also act as collateral for borrowing other assets.

Compound, at the time this module was written, is one of the biggest DeFi projects in the lending category with approximately $5billion worth of assets locked in their protocol.

Another popular DeFi project in this category is **Aave**.

## Stable Coins – Algorithmic and Non-Algorithmic

An algorithmic stable coin is a type of stablecoin that is stabilised using an algorithm, as opposed to being backed by physical assets like gold or USD. There are a few different types of algorithmic stable coins, but the most common type is one that is stabilised using a cryptocurrency like Ethereum.

One of the most well-known examples of an algorithmic stablecoin is MakerDAO. MakerDAO uses a system called “**Collateralised Debt Position (CDP)**” to stabilise the Dai token. When someone wants to buy Dai, they need to lock in a certain amount of collateral into the CDP. 

The value of the collateral is then used to generate new Dai tokens. If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, the system automatically liquidates the collateral to cover the debt.

This system is designed to keep the value of Dai stable around $1 USD.

In addition to MakerDAO, there are multiple other non-algorithmic stablecoins like USDT, USDC or PAX.

The primary drawback with them is that they are centralised, since there is a corporation in charge of maintaining the equivalent value of stablecoins in dollars or other assets. Nonetheless, these stablecoins have become popular and are extensively utilised in a variety of DeFi applications, including Compound and Aave.

Let’s take USDC for example, it is a type of fiat-collateralised stablecoin, meaning that each USDC token is backed by one US dollar held in reserve. USDC is an ERC20 token, which means it runs on the Ethereum blockchain. 

USDC reserves are held in the custody and management of leading U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and BNY Mellon. Each month, Grant Thornton LLP, one of America’s largest audit, tax and advisory firms, provides third-party assurance as to the size of the USDC reserve.

## Decentralised Exchanges

Centralised exchanges are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies – think Coinbase, Binance or Kraken. However, they are also one of the most risky ways to do so. 

This is because centralised exchanges are a prime target for hackers. In fact, over $1 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen from centralised exchanges in just the past few years, like Crypto.com, AscendEX, BitMart, Liquid, KueCoin, Binance, to name a few.

This is where decentralised exchanges (DEXs) come in. DEXs are exchanges that allow you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without giving up custody of your coins. This is possible because DEXs are built on blockchain technology. This means that they are trustless and permissionless.

DEXs also have other advantages over centralised exchanges. For example, decentralised exchanges do not require you to provide personal information like your name or address. This makes them a more privacy-friendly option.

There are 2 main types of DEXs:

1. **Liquidity pool based** – A few examples are Uniswap, Kyber, Balancer or Bancor.
2. **Order book based** – A couple of examples are Loopring and IDEX

Further, the concept and differences of **Market Makers (MM)** and **Automated Market Makers (AMM)** are important to DeFi because that is how liquidity and pricing on Decentralised Exchanges is managed. 

## Derivatives

Similarly to traditional finance, derivatives are contracts that derive their value from the performance of an underlying asset. The main use case for derivatives is to provide exposure to different assets without having to actually hold those assets.

One of the most common types of derivatives are options contracts. An option contract gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on or before a specific date.

Another common type of derivative is a futures contract. A futures contract is very similar to an options contract, but it instead gives the holder the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on or before a specific date. This means that if you buy a futures contract, you are committing to buying or selling the underlying asset at the specified price.

The most important DeFi application in this space is **Synthetix**, a decentralised platform that provides on-chain exposure to various assets. 

With Synthetix, you can create synthetic assets, which are digital tokens that track the price of a real-world asset. For example, you could create a synthetic token that tracks the price of gold. This would allow you to get exposure to the price of gold without actually having to buy or hold any gold.

Synthetix is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to create and track synthetic assets. This means that it is a trustless and permissionless platform. 

In addition, Synthetix also allows you to create synthetic tokens that track the price of other cryptocurrencies. This means that you can get exposure to the price of a cryptocurrency without actually having to hold that cryptocurrency.

## Margin Trading

Margin trading is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in a certain asset. This is similar to traditional finance, where people use loans to purchase assets.

Some of the main DeFi apps in the margin trading space are dYdX and Fulcrum.

**dYdX** and **Fulcrum** are decentralised margin trading platforms that allow users to trade Ethereum-based assets. They use smart contracts to facilitate trades and borrowing. This means that they are trustless and permissionless platforms. 

## Insurance

In the world of decentralised finance, insurance is a key component of risk management. There are a number of different types of insurance that can be used in the DeFi space, but the most common are insurance against smart contract failures and insurance for deposits.

One of the most popular DeFi projects in this space is **Nexus Mutual**. **Nexus Mutual** is a decentralised insurance company that uses smart contracts to protect its members from losses due to contract failures.

Another popular project in this area is **Opyn**. **Opyn** is a decentralised insurance company that uses blockchain technology to protect its members from theft and fraud.

## Oracles

Oracles can be used to deliver reliable data feeds from the outside world (also known as off-chain data) into smart contracts. They are used to either verify information or execute payments in smart contracts. You can see them as a smart contract’s “eyes and ears” so it can interact with the real world. This is particularly applicable to the Insurance & Payments industry. 

The most popular project in this space is **Chainlink**.

## What are the risks? 

DeFi projects are still in their early stages and as such, they come with a variety of risks. The main risks are bugs in smart contracts and protocol changes that can affect the existing contracts.

We must always examine how decentralised a DeFi project really is and what the shutdown procedure is should something go wrong.

Furthermore, we must always anticipate the more systemic risk that may result from asset prices plummeting dramatically, which might lead to a cascading sequence of liquidations across multiple DeFi protocols. This happened in May of 2022 when the LUNA token crashed to 0 within a matter of days. 

Network fees and congestion can also be a problem, especially if we want to avoid liquidations. The Ethereum Merge and Layer 2 scaling solutions help to solve this problem.

By understanding the risks associated with DeFi projects, we can be better prepared to handle them should they arise.

## Conclusion

DeFi is a term used to describe decentralised financial products and services. These products and services are built on top of blockchain technology and protocols, and they aim to provide more efficient, transparent, and secure alternatives to the traditional financial system.

The DeFi space is still in its early days, but is a rapidly growing industry that offers a lot of potential for disruption. There are some risks associated with it, but the potential rewards are high.

There are now dozens of DeFi products and services available, including decentralised exchanges, lending platforms, staking services, and more.

DeFi is built on new rails that rely on blockchain technology instead of outdated technologies used by banks. This makes it more open and accessible to everyone.

There are a lot of opportunities in DeFi and it is likely to continue to grow rapidly in the future. However, we must always be aware of the risks associated with it and be prepared to handle them if they arise.

Although DeFi is currently built predominantly on Ethereum, with more adoption of interoperability protocols we are seeing more projects being built on different chains too.
