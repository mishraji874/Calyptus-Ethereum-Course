# Yield Farming

Yield farming is a strategy employed by cryptocurrency investors to maximise returns on their investments by using different DeFi protocols.

Yield farmers are always attempting to get the highest yield possible by frequently changing their strategies. The most profitable strategies usually involve at least a few DeFi protocols like Compound, Curve, Synthetix, Uniswap or Balancer. 

If the strategy doesn’t work anymore or if there is a better strategy available the yield farmers move their funds around. They may, for example, move the funds between different protocols or they may swap some of their cryptocurrency to others with a higher yield. In the yield farming world, this procedure is often referred to as **crop rotation**.

It’s much like people in traditional finance search for the best saving account with the highest APY. The acronym APY stands for annualised percentage yield, and it’s a common way to measure performance across different investments. It’s also a common way of expressing the returns of different yield farming strategies.

Traditional savings accounts may have anywhere from 0.1% to 3% APY. Anything in excess of 3% is unusual these days. On the other hand, some yield farmers are seeing astronomical returns of more than 100% APY.

But how is that possible, and what’s the catch?

Liquidity mining, leverage, and risk are the three primary components that allow for such returns. Before we get into some typical strategies, let’s take a look at each of them.

## Liquidity Mining
Liquidity mining is a process of distributing tokens to protocol users as an incentive for adding liquidity. The first DeFi project to introduce liquidity mining was Synthetix, which rewarded users who added liquidity to the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap with SNX tokens.

Liquidity mining adds monetary incentives to yield farmers by giving token rewards on top of the yield created by utilising a specific protocol. Depending on the protocol, these incentives may be so strong that farmers are willing to forgo their initial capital to receive more rewards in distributed tokens. This makes their overall strategy highly profitable.

A good example of this was the liquidity mining of COMP tokens introduced by Compound that was initially giving higher rewards to the users who were borrowing assets with the highest APY. This incentivised farmers to start borrowing these assets as the value of minted COMP tokens was compensating them for the high borrowing rates they had to pay. COMP’s liquidity mining rapidly became popular and essentially jumpstarted yield farming’s popularity.

## Leverage

Another key ingredient for ultra-high returns is leverage. Leverage is a method of using borrowed money to boost the potential return on investment.

In our yield farming world, farmers can deposit their cryptocurrency as collateral to one of the lending protocols and borrow other cryptocurrency. Now they can use the borrowed cryptocurrency as further collateral and borrow even more! By repeating the whole procedure farmers can leverage their initial capital a few times over and start generating even greater returns (or losses) on their initial capital.

## Risk
The last missing component of double-digit and triple-digit APYs is the high risk that farmers are prepared to take.


The first one is related to the previous topic that we discussed – leverage. Farmers are taking out loans that are overcollateralized, meaning if the (e.g. dollar) value of the collateral falls below a certain point, it can be liquidated.

Aside from the liquidation danger, we must consider our normal smart contract dangers such as flaws, platform upgrades, admin keys, and systemic risks, for example. In addition, we have a number of new attack vectors particular to DeFi, such as draining specific liquidity pools.

All of these risks put together are yet another reason why yield farming returns are so lucrative. It’s a high-risk, high-reward game.

## Farming Strategies
Yield farming methods are a collection of procedures for generating a high return on investment. They usually include at least one of the following elements: lending and borrowing, supplying capital to liquidity pools, or staking LP tokens.

**Lending and borrowing.** A fairly simple way of getting APY on your capital. Farmers can for example supply stablecoins such as DAI or USDC on one of the lending platforms and start getting a return on their capital. 

Liquidity mining and leverage can supercharge that. Farmers may be rewarded with extra COMP tokens for lending and borrowing on Compound, for example. They can also borrow money against the assets in their account to acquire even more cryptocurrency. This, of course, entails the possibility of liquidation.

**Supplying capital to liquidity pools.** Yield farmers can supply cryptocurrency to one of the liquidity pools in protocols like Uniswap, Balancer or Curve and get rewarded with fees that are charged when certain crypto pairs (e.g. ETH/BTC) are swapped for one another . 

Also, liquidity mining can invigorate this process so that, for example, by supplying cryptocurrency to different liquidity pools, farmers are rewarded with additional tokens. Balancer is a good example of a protocol that rewards liquidity pool suppliers with extra BAL tokens, increasing their APY.

**Staking LP tokens.** Users may further improve their odds by staking their liquidity provider or LP tokens, which represent their stake in a liquidity pool, according to certain protocols. For example, Synthetix, REN and Curve got into a partnership where users can add wBTC, sBTC and renBTC to the Curve BTC liquidity pool and receive Curve LP tokens in return. These tokens can be staked on Synthetix Mintr where farmers can be further rewarded in CRV, BAL, SNX, and REN tokens.

These strategies are often combined so that yield farmers can maximise their returns even further.

It’s worth remembering however that yield farming methods can become obsolete quickly, especially if protocol or incentive adjustments occur. Something that was previously profitable may no longer be so the next day, therefore it’s critical to keep an eye on running strategies and change crops if required.

## Conclusion
It’s worth noting that yield farming is a relatively new concept, and it isn’t yet completely efficient. This means that there are plenty of possibilities out there that can provide us with a much greater return on our investment than we could find in traditional finance or even centralised crypto finance. This comes of course with certain risks, some of which we may not even be aware of yet.

While yield farming has the potential to increase DeFi protocol adoption and bring more users into the fold, it could also add confusion for many users & put them off farming their cryptocurrency. For example, users may see that the borrowing rates on Compound change frequently and they might not be familiar with how different COMP token distribution strategies work, so they’d stay away.
